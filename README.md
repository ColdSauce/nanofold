# Nanofold
This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of predicting protein structure from
a given residue sequence. It uses the [Alphafold](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2)
paper as a basis, modifying details where necessary to allow for training and inference on a single
machine on a mid tier GPU.
